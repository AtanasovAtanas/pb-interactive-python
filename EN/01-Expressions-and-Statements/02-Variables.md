# How computing works?
Computers are machines that process data. The process of receiving information is called **input**. 

The input needs to be stored in the computer memory and it can be done by using variables.

# Variables
In programming, each **variable** stores a certain value of a particular type.

For example, data types can be: number, letter, text (string), date, color, image, list and others. 

Here are some examples of data types:
* integer: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, …
* float: 0.5, 3.14, -1.5, …
* character (symbol): 'a', 'b', 'c', '@', 'X', …
* text (string): "Hello", "Hi", "How are you?", …
* day of week: Monday, Tuesday, …, Sunday
* date and time: 14-June-1980 6:30:00, 25-Dec-2017 23:17:22

A **variable** is a container of information:
```python
first_name = "John"
``` 

The information can be changed at any time:
```python
first_name = "John"
first_name = "Peter"
``` 
In Python programming variables are used all the time.

You can also imagine that **variables** are containers for data or named areas in the memory and the data that they are storing can be read and changed at any time. 

**Variables** basically provide means for:
* **Storing** information
* **Retrieving** stored info
* **Modifying** stored info

Variables are characterized by:
* **name** (identifier)
* **type** (of the information preserved)
* **value** (stored information)

Each of the variables in **Python** has a name, a type and a value. 

Here is how we would declare a variable and assign it with a value at the same time:
```python
age = 25
# variable name
# variable value (type: integer)
```
