# Data Types
Variables can be used to hold different data types

**int** - integer number : 1, 2, 3, 4 ….

**float** - real number : 0.5 , 3.14, -0.5 ….

**str** - string and chars : "a", "Hello", …

**bool** - boolean: True, False

# Assigning Values to Variables
You can assign a **value** to a **variable** using **"="**:
```python
first_num = 10
second_num = 5
first_num + second_num   # 15
```

# Naming Conventions
In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the name to be used for variables

In Python the convention for naming variables is **"snake_case"**:
* Words consist only of **lowercase** letters
* Words are separated with **underscore** "_"

```python
this_is_correct
thisIsNotCorrect
This_Is_Not_Correct
This_is_also_not_correct
```

There are other conventions such as:
* Pascal Case - capitalizes each word, removes the space:
```python
FirstName = "Peter"
```

* Camel Case - similiar to Pascal Case but the first word is not capitalized:
```python
firstName = "Peter"
```

# Data Types are Dynamic
In Python data types are dynamic

A single variable can be used to hold different data types
```python
x = 5        # x is Number
x = "John"   # x is String
x = True     # x is Boolean
```
[/slide]

# Strings
Strings are data types that can store text

To set a string value to a variable you can use single or double quotes:
```python
first_name = "John" 
last_name = 'Adams'
```
But you cannot use both together:
```python
first_name = 'John" 
# this will not work  

```

# Comments
A comment is text in your program that is not executed as a code

* Commonly used to document code

```python
# name = "John" <- this code will not be executed
```
