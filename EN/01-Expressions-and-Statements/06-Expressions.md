# Expressions
**Expressions** == sequences of operators, literals and variables which are evaluated to a value.

Expressions are different from statements in the fact that statements do something while expressions are representation of value. 
An expression can be broken down into operators and operands:

  * at least one **operand**
  * 1 or more **operators**

```python
y = x + 5
```
```python
name = "John Doe"
```
```python
r = (150-20) / 2 + 5
```
