# Expressions
**Expressions** are sequences of operators, literals and variables which are evaluated to a value.

Expressions are different from statements in the fact that statements do something while expressions are representation of value. 

An expression can be broken down into operators and operands:
  * at least one **operand**
  * 1 or more **operators**

```python
y = x + 5
```

```python
name = "John Doe"
```

```python
r = (150-20) / 2 + 5
```

# Priorities of arithmetic operations
The standard rule for priorities of arithmetic operations is applied: multiplying and dividing are always done before adding and subtracting. 

In case of an expression in brackets, it is calculated first.

When two operators share an operand the operator with the higher **precedence** goes first. 

For example, `1 + 2 * 3` is treated as `1 + (2 * 3)`, whereas `1 * 2 + 3` is treated as `(1 * 2) + 3` since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition.
