# What is Coding?
**Coding** means to give **commands** to tell the computer what to do

Sample command:
```python
print("I am coding")
```
A **computer program** is a sequence of commands
```python
print("First command")
print("Second command")
print("Third command")
```

# Commands in Python – Examples 
Calculate an expression and print its value:
```python
print(5 + 5)
```
Calculate an area of rectangle:
```python
print(base * height / 2)
```
Print the numbers from 1 to 100
```python
for i in range(1, 101):
    print(i)
```

# Programming and Algorithms 
**Programming** means writing computer programs (commands). Computer programs usually execute some algorithm. 

## Programming
Algorithms are a sequence of steps, necessary for the completion of a certain task and for gaining some expected result, something like a "recipe". 

We need to use a certain **programming language**, such as C# or Python, to write it.

## Algorithms
**Algorithm** is a sequence of commands that achieves certain result

In programming the computer programs execute algorithms: a sequence of commands, necessary for 
the completion of a certain task. 
    - For example, to arrange a sequence of numbers in an ascending order, an algorithm is needed, e.g. find the smallest number and print it, then find the smallest number among the rest of the numbers and print it, and this is repeated until there are no more numbers left.

Programming is done by **programmers** (developers)

Programmers use IDE (like Pycharm) to:

* **Write** the code
* **Run** and test the code
* Find a fix **bugs** (debug the code)

For convenience when creating programs, for writing programming code, for execution of programs and other operations related to programming, we need a development environment.

# Computer Program – Example
Computer programs represent a sequence of commands that are written in certain programming language, like C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, PHP, C, Ruby, Swift, Go or another.

Sample **Python** (sequence of Python commands):

```python
size = 5
print("Size = ", size)
print("Area = ", size * size)
```
The above program holds a sequence of 3 commands:
 * Declaring and assigning a variable: size = 5;
 * Calculating and printing an expression: print("Size = ", size)
 * Calculating and printing an expression: print("Size = ", size)

The result (output) from the above program is as follows:
```csharp
Size = 5
Area = 25
```
