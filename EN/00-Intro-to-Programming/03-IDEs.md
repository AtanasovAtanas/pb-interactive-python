# Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
Integrated Development Environments (**IDE**) simplify software development
 * IDEs save time and eases the process of coding
 * Writing, running, testing, and debugging the code
 * For programming in C#, we use **PyCharm Community**

They are actually editors for programs, in which we write the program code and we can compile it and run it to see the errors, fix them and start the program again.

To write programs, we need an **IDE**

For **Python**:

* **PyCharm** (IDE)
* **Visual Studio Code** (free editor)
* **Eclipse** (IDE)

For **Java** -> IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans

For **JavaScript** -> VS Code / WebStorm

For **C#** -> Visual Studio / Raider
