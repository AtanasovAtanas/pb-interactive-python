# Programming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters
The **programming language** defines a set of rules (syntax)

Languages are either **compiled** (like Java, C#, C++) or **interpreted** (like JavaScript and Python)

The **compiler** translates programming code to **machine code**

* During the compilation, it finds syntax errors

The **interpreter** executes the code line by line

* It finds syntax errors at runtime
