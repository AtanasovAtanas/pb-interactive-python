# Programming Languages
A programming language is an artificial language (syntax for expression), 
meant for giving commands that we want the computer to read, process and execute. 
Using programming languages, we write sequences of commands (programs), which define 
what the computer should do. 

Examples of programming languages are C#, Java, JavaScript, 
Python, C, C++, PHP, Swift, Go and many others. These languages differ in their philosophy, 
syntax, purpose, programming constructions and execution environment. The execution of computer
programs can be done with a compiler or with an interpreter.

# Compilers
The compiler translates the code from programming language to machine code, as for each
of the constructions (commands) in the code it chooses a proper, previously prepared fragment 
of machine code and in the meantime it checks the text of the program for errors. Together, 
the compiled fragments comprise the program into a machine code, as the microprocessor of the 
computer expects it.

# Interpreters
The interpreter is "a program for executing programs", written in some programming language. 
It executes the commands in the program one after another, as it understands not only a single 
command and sequences of commands, but also other language constructions.

# The Python Language
**Python** is an interpreted programming language

Used for developing complex scientific and numeric applications

Good choice for **beginners**

* Easy syntax, easy to read, **easy to learn**
* Big developer **community**, many jobs
* Lots of **resources**: books, lessons, courses

# Python Execution
Python is a **high-level language**, which is **interpreted**. 

An **interpreted language** is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations 
execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language 
instructions. In the simple definition of “interpreted”, executing a program means reading the 
source file a line at a time, and doing what it says. 

A program in Python is written in text format (**source code**)

The **interpreter** executes the code line by line
