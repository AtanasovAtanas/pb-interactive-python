# If...else Statement
In an if-else statement, **`if`** condition evaluates to **`true`**, the then-statement runs. If condition is false, the else-statement runs

Because condition can't be simultaneously true and false, the then-statement and the else-statement of an if-else statement can **never both run**

In an if statement that doesn't include an else statement, **if condition is true, the then-statement runs**
  * **If condition is false**, control is transferred to the next statement after the if statement
 
```python
if condition:
  # then-statement
  # Commands to be executed if the condition is true
else:
  # else-statement
  # Commands to be executed if the condition is false
```

# Example: If...else Statement
```python
color = "red"
if color == "red":
   print("tomato")
   print("strawberry") 
else:
   print("banana")
   print("lemon")
```
