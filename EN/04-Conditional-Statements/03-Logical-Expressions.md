# Value Comparison
In programming we can **compare** values

The result of the logical expressions is either ***True*** or ***False***
```python
a = 5
b = 10
print(a < b)            # True
print(a > 100)          # False
print(a == '5')         # False
print(a <= 5)           # True
print(b == 2 * a)       # True
``` 

Comparing text using the equality operator \(==\)
```python
a = "5"
b = "5"
print(a == b)     # True
```
