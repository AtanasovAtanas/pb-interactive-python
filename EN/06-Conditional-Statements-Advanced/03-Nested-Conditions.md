# Nested Conditions
An ***if...else*** statement can exist within another ***if...else*** statement

Generally used when we have to test one condition followed by another

It's not a good practice to exceed **three nested levels**

Only if the first condition is true the nested one is checked
```python
if expression:
  if nested expression:
    # Code to be executed
  else:
    # Code to be executed
# Executes when the nested expression is false
```
