# The if Statement
Very often you want to perform different actions for different conditions

The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is true

```python
hour = int(input())

if hour < 18:
    print("Good day")
```

# The else Statement
If the condition is false, another statement can be executed

```python
hour = int(input())

if hour < 18:
    print("Good day")
else:
    print("Good evening")
```

# The elif Statement

The ***if-else*** statement can be in a series

```python
hour = int(input())

if hour < 10:
    print("Good morning")
elif hour < 18:
    print("Good day")
else:
    print("Good evening")
```
